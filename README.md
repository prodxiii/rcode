## Description

Visual Studio Code has an extension called [**Remote VSCode**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rafaelmaiolla.remote-vscode) which allows Textmate 2 remote coding feature to be used 
in VSCode. This is a helper script to be installed on the remote server. The original helper 
script provided with TM2 is implemented in ruby. Here is [aurora's](https://github.com/aurora) 
attempt to replace this ruby script with a shell script, because in some cases a ruby 
installation might just be too much overhead for just editing remote files.

The shell script needs to be copied to the server, you want to remote edit files, on.
After that, open your TM2 preferences and enable "Allow rcode connections" setting in
the "Terminal" settings and adjust the setting "Access for" according to your needs:

This script is a modification of the original bash script created for 
remote Textmate 2 which can be found at:
[rmate](https://github.com/aurora/rmate)

### Quick install

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/rcode https://raw.github.com/prox33/rcode/master/rcode
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/rcode
```

### Local clients

It's a good idea to allow access only for local clients. In this case you need to open
a SSH connection to the system you want to edit a file on and specify a remote tunnel in
addition:

	ssh -R 52698:localhost:52698 user@example.com

If you are logged in on the remote system, you can now just execute

	rcode test.txt


### Remote clients

On some machines, where port forwarding is not possible, for example due to a missing ssh
daemon, you can allow access for "remote clients". Just ssh or telnet to the remote machine
and execute:

    rcode -H vscode-host test.txt

## Requirements

A bash with compiled support for "/dev/tcp" is required. This is not the case on some
older linux distributions, like Ubuntu 9.x.

## Usage

Edit specified file

    $ ./rcode [arguments] [--] file-path

Read text from stdin

    $ echo "hello Visual Studio Code" | ./rcode [arguments] -

### Arguments

    -H, --host HOST  Connect to HOST. Use 'auto' to detect the host from SSH.
    -p, --port PORT  Port number to use for connection.
    -w, --[no-]wait  Wait for file to be closed by Visual Studio Code.
    -l, --line LINE  Place caret on line number after loading file.
    +N               Alias for --line, if N is a number (eg.: +5).
    -m, --name NAME  The display name shown in Visual Studio Code.
    -t, --type TYPE  Treat file as having specified type.
    -n, --new        Open in a new window (Sublime Text).
    -f, --force      Open even if file is not writable.
    -v, --verbose    Verbose logging messages.
    -h, --help       Display this usage information.
        --version    Show version and exit.


### Default parameter configuration

Some default parameters (_host_ and _port_) can be configured by defining them
as the environment variables `RCODE_HOST` and `RCODE_PORT` or by putting them
in a configuration file. The configuration files loaded are `/etc/rcode.rc`
and `~/.rcode.rc`, e.g.:

    host: auto  # prefer host from SSH_CONNECTION over localhost
    port: 52698

Alternative notation for configuration file is:

    host=auto
    port=52698

The precedence for setting the configuration is (higher precedence counts):

1. default (localhost, 52698)
2. /etc/rcode.rc
3. ~/.rcode/rcode.rc
4. ~/.rcode.rc
5. environment variables (RCODE\_HOST, RCODE\_PORT)
